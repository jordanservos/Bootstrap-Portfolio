# Updated-Portfolio

Now that I've had some practice with HTML and have a project to share, I updated my portfolio page and other materials to build toward being employer competitive.

# Information

You'll find the following information on my updated portfolio!

# Content
- My name
- Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number
- List of projects. For each project make sure you have the following:
- Project titles
- Page is full deployed
- Link to the code on GitHub

# Design
- Mobile-friendliness: you don't need advanced responsive styles, but you should ensure that your portfolio page is still readable on different screen sizes
- Readability: make sure the font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
